/* Implementation of functions to transmit data or strings over the TRACESWO
 * wire of the ARM Cortex micro-controllers.
 *
 * These routines pack the bytes to * transmit into 32-bit words, in order to
 * minimize overhead (each item that is transmitted over the TRACESWO pin is
 * prefixed with a 1-byte header, so that when tranmitting single bytes, each
 * byte has that 1-byte header overhead).
 *
 * Routines for initializing the micro-controller for TRACESWO are not included,
 * as these are (in part) dependend on the particular micro-controller.
